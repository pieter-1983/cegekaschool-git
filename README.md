# Merge Exercise
We're working on our `fugufusion` branch, which holds a recipe to use in a Fusion kitchen.

You're job is to get your current changes in the `master` branch.
And you want to first pull whatever important changes are in the `master` branch, like - I dunno - a recipe that actually **doesn't** kill anyone?

But look out, some guy that started the `ratings` branch, accidentally started his work from our `fugufusion` branch.

Apparently he discovered his whoopsie too late and decided to revert our commits! 

The devious bastard then merged his branch with `master` and deleted his own temporary feature branch.

## Exercise 1
Don't hide his mistakes and accept that it's ok to revert his reverts of our commits.

## Exercise 2
Try hiding his mistake(s)

Your end result should look like this on the `master` branch:

    root
     \-- fusion
          \-- fugufusion.md
     \-- README.md
     \-- fugu.txt
     \-- ratings.md

# Preparing Fugu
The main point of preparing fugu is to remove all signs of tetrodotoxin, 
which is generally found everywhere but the flesh. 

Tetrodotoxin is rapid and violent, causing numbness around the mouth, paralysis and finally death. 
It is said to be 1,000 times more potent than cyanide and there is of course no antidote.

While the preparation of fugu should be left to professionals and you should definitely not try this at home, 
it’s interesting to know what steps the chefs need to follow to ensure the fugu is safe for eating.

## Step 1
Remove the skin (there are no scales). Cut around the mouth and from there, pull the skin off.

## Step 2
Wash off the jelly using salt.

## Step 3
Remove the eyes.

## Step 4
Using a good, sharp knife, gut the fish being very careful not to puncture the ovaries or liver.
Should these burst, the toxins will be released into the flesh making the fish inedible.

Under no circumstance should you feed this to someone! It will kill them (see above)!

## Step 5
Cutting against the bone, fillet as you would any other sashimi.

## Step 6
Cut the head into two or three pieces and boil. This can be used for a stew.

Fugu is definitely the type of delicacy that people travel to try – just make sure if you do try it, 
it’s been prepared correctly by someone with the right training.

## Fugu Tempura Tacos
The thing about tempura batter is it should be mixed with equal parts ice cold soda water and egg yolks 
(2 is good), stirred rapidly with chopsticks for only a short time 
in order to preserve the lumpy quality characteristic to tempura. 
 
So, after heating your wok full of an oil with a high smoking point- sesame, 
peanut or vegetable (or even a mixture thereof)- oil to 190°F, cutting the fugu
into chunks, prepare your batter mixture. When the batter floats the oil is ready to go, 
though you don’t want to fry too much as once as the oil temperature will drop too low, 
screwing the Kitchen Adonis image your drooling audience has of you all to hell.

Take out of oil after 2-3 minutes and nicely golden, resting on a paper towel for a bit to soak up excess oil. 
Salt it! Of course you’ve already made your red onion, tomato, pepper based pico de gallo, 
cut the avocado into long green quarter moons, and been heating your corn tortillas all the while, right? 

So, once your tempura's done and dried a bit, throw it on that tortilla, 
adding the previously mentioned accoutrements and get to eating while it’s still hot.
